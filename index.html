            <p>You might have seen or have not seen me playing CS:GO in pug , tournaments and wrecking other players and destroying their will to play CS:GO ever again in their life. But games won't pay my bills , at least not in this country. So to pay my bills I need a job that pays well . That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.</p>
